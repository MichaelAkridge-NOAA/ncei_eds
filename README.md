# NCEI Environmental Data Summary (EDS) Codespace
[![Open RStudio in GitHub Codespaces](./.devcontainer/badge_codespaces_rstudio.png)](https://codespaces.new/MichaelAkridge-NOAA/ncei_eds_codespace?quickstart=1)

The EDS allows users to download/filter/extract/summarize large amounts of gridded and tabular data given user-defined time stamps and geographical coordinates. The various external environmental data summarized at individual survey sites can aid scientists to assess and understand how living marine resources are impacted by the environmental variabilities.

## Metadata
The EDS tool was developed by scientists of the Ecosystem Sciences Division (ESD) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). The survey data utilized in tool development was funded by the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program (NCRMP) as well as other related projects including the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) and USAID. The EDS is an advanced environmental data summary tool that gives users a simple, consistent way to enhance in situ survey data with external environmental data. The EDS is written in R and provides users an interface to NOAA CoastWatch and OceanWatch datasets through the ERDDAP server protocol. The oceanographic parameters involved in this tool include chlorophyll A, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), turbidity (Kd490), wave height, and sea surface temperature (SST) measurements. The EDS outputs were summarized at NCRMP REA Site level from 2000 to 2020 across 57 islands covered by the survey.
